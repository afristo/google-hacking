# google-hacking

The purpose of this repository is to aggregate all the google advanced query search operators that I could find. I was unable to locate complete, exhaustive, official documentation. Rather, I had to peruse multiple, unofficial sources. I have tried to combine these sources into a single table. The sources are located at the bottom under the "Google Hacking Sources" heading.

## Google Hacking Operators
All google hacking operators are contained below and logically grouped by their function.

### Logical Search Operators
These search operators allow you to construct searches via basic logic. Including whole strings, partial strings, setting and/or/not logic of strings, setting string proximity, etc. The following operators are demonstrated in the context of conducting an OSINT investigation to understand funding for the American Heart Association.

| Operator | Description | Syntax | Example |
| :------: | :---------- | :----: | :-----: |
| * | Matches anything. | {string} * {string} | American Heart Association * Donors |
| "" | The string must match exactly (case-insensitive). | "{string}" | "American Heart Association" |
| AND | Match this term as well. This is technically implicit in any search with a space and is usually redundant. | {string} + {string} | American + Heart + Association (equivalent to searching: American Heart Association) |
| OR | Match the first term or the second term. | {string} OR {string} | American Heart Association OR AHA |
| \| | Match the first term or the second term. | {string} OR {string} | American Heart Association \| AHA |
| - | Exclude the term that follows the operator. | -{string} | AHA -historical |
| #..# | Search a range of numbers, including the ends. | {number}..{number} | AHA donations for 2000..2010 |
| AROUND(n) | Match pages containing the search terms separated by at most n words. | {string} AROUND(5) {string} | American Heart Association AROUND(5) funding |
| () | Group many terms and operators, allows construction of more advanced searches. | ({terms and operators}) | American Heart Association AND (funding OR donors OR fundraising) |

### Scope Restricting Search Operators
These operators narrow the broad scope of a search through different methods such as time, specific websites, url contents, etc. The following operators are demonstrated in the context of conducting an OSINT investigation to understand funding for the American Heart Association.

| Operator | Description | Syntax | Example |
| :------: | :---------- | :----: | :-----: |
| @ | Restrict search to popular social media sites. Not as precise as the site: operator. | @{platform} {search string} | @youtube american heart association |
| after: | Search for results after a given date. | {string} after:{yyyy-mm-dd} | AHA donations after:2024-01-01 |
| allintitle: | Find results with multiple words in the title tag. | {search string} allintitle:{string} {string} | AHA allintitle:FY financial |
| allinurl: | Find results with multiple words in the url. | {search string} allinurl:{string} | AHA allinurl:files finance |
| allintext: | Find results with a multiple words in the text of the document. | {search string} allintext:{string} {string} | AHA allintext:donor contributions |
| before: | Search for results before a given date. | {string} before:{yyyy-mm-dd} | AHA biggest donors before:2015-06-03 |
| ext: | Search for results containing a [specific file extension](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types) (identical to filetype: operator) (e.g. PDF, XLSX, etc.). | {search string} ext:{string} | AHA ext:pdf |
| filetype: | Search for results containing a [specific filetype](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types) (identical to ext: operator) (e.g. PDF, XLSX, etc.). | {search string} filetype:{string} | AHA filetype:pdf |
| intext: | Find results with a specific word in the text of the document. | {search string} intext:{string} | AHA intext:donors |
| intitle: | Find results with a specific word in the title tag. | {search string} intitle:{string} | american heart association intitile:disclosure |
| inurl: | Find results with a specific word in the URL of the document. | {search string} inurl:{string} | american heart association inurl:finance |
| related: | Search for documents that are related to the given website. | {search string} related:{string} | donations related:heart.org |
| site: | Search only on a given site. The argument may also be a TLD such as com, net, etc. | {search string} site:{string} | donation site:heart.org |

### Topic-Specific Search Operators
These operators allow you to search for a specific type of information about something, like the weather, stock price information, information about movies, etc.
| Operator | Description | Syntax | Example |

| weather: | Search for information about the weather of the given location. | weather:{string} | weather:Dallas |
